## Hi there 👋

<!--
I'm a graduate Data Science student at George Washington University, with a strong focus on machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Maryland. 

I'm very interested in solving the world's problems and automating solutions to such problems using core data science principles like machine learning and data analysis. I primarily use Python and SQL, but I do have experience with R as well.

I was formerly an intern for AI Colab under Georgetown University and MedStar Health. 

**Skills:**

Data storytelling | exploratory data analysis | machine learning | natural language processing | statistical modeling

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a natural language processing project, and another machine learning project too
- 🌱 I’m currently learning natural language processing, time series analysis
- 💬 Ask me about data driven solutions, storytelling with data, journalism
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born on halloween
